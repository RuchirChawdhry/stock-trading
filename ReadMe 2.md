- For unix environments (linux distrox and macOS), `curses` is already available in the Python Standard Library. No need to install anything.
- The Windows version of Python doesn't include the `curses` module. You can install [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/) package to use curses on Windows. Install it using this pip command:

				```pip install windows-curses```
